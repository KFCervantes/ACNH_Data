I like to use a lot of `tidyverse` stuff so this may be a good thing to load.
```{r}
library(tidyverse) # metapackage of all tidyverse packages
```

I played a lot of *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* since April 2020 so I thought it might be fun to look through some data for the game.

The dataset includes a lot of files and it may be beneficial to look at what some of them are.
```{r}
list.files(path = "../input")
```
